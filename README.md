# The Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository conducts extraction of web articles published by the Institute for the Study of War. It then conducts natural language processing (NLP) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to structure the extracted web data, and enriches some of the data through the use of external APIs (like the Open Cage geocoding API). 

This notebook is the subject of an article on Towards Data Science, accessible here: https://towardsdatascience.com/something-from-nothing-use-nlp-and-ml-to-extract-and-structure-web-data-3f49b2f72b13
